##Part 1
1. Open the diamonds dataset from ggplot2.   
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")
```

2. Run a correlation between the x and y variables. What do you notice? 
```{r}
cor(diamonds$x,diamonds$y)
#They are highly positively correlated, r = 0.9747.
```
3. What is the correlation between price and carat?
```{r}
cor(diamonds$price,diamonds$carat) #r = 0.9216
```
4. Create a linear model predicting price from table. What is the coefficient for table? 
```{r}
lm1 <- lm(price~table,diamonds)
summary(lm1) #226.984
```
5. Run a regression and an Anova predicting price from color. What do you notice? 
```{r}
lm2 <- lm(price~color,diamonds)
summary(lm2)

Anova(lm2)
#They do the same thing (LM summary showed an F value that was the same as the ANOVA) but you would need a post-hoc test for the Anova.
```
6. Open the warpbreaks dataset. What test would you use to determine the correlation between wool type and breaks?
```{r}
data("warpbreaks")
#Wool type is dichotomous/binary and breaks are numeric, so point biserial correlation
```

7. What is the correlation between wool type and breaks? 
```{r}
biserial.cor(warpbreaks$breaks,warpbreaks$wool)
```

8. A student has a 25 question, multiple choice test. Each question has 4 choices. If they answered 17 questions correctly, did their responses differ from chance?  
```{r}
binom.test(17,25,0.25) #Yes, they differ from chance alone, p = 0.000007364
```

##Part 2
Here is a little information about the variables in the dataset you'll use for part 2. 
**School variables:**
schoolid: school's ID number
housepov: % of households in neighborhood of school below poverty level

**Classroom variables:**
classid: classroom's ID number
yearstea: years of teacher's experience in teaching the first grade
mathprep: the number of preparatory courses on the first grade contents and methods followed by teacher
mathknow: teacher's knowledge of first grade math contents

**Student variables:**
childid: Student ID
mathgain: student's gain in math achievement scores from spring of K through spring of first grade
mathkind: student's math score in spring of kindergarten year
sex: student's sex
minority: if minority or not
ses: child's socioeconomic status

1. Import the multilevel data from the SchoolsClassStudents.csv file
```{r}
school <- schoolsClassStudents
```

2. Scale and center your mathgain, ses, and mathprep variables.
```{r}
school$zSES <- scale(school$ses)
school$zMathgain <- scale(school$mathgain)
school$zMathprep <- scale(school$mathprep)
```

3. Load lme4 and lmerTest
```{r}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
```

4. Run an intercept only model predicting math improvement for students.

BONUS: What is the between-class variance? What is the within-class variance?

5. Run a model of students nested within classrooms to determine if the first-level predictor of child SES predicts child's improvement in scores, without modeling a random slope.

BONUS: What does this tell us and what does a fixed slope not tell us?

6. Compare the model from level-1 predictor model of SES (question 5) to the intercept only model with a likelihood ratio test

7. Run the level-1 predictor model of SES (question 5) but now model with a random slope for SES. Does your inference change? What parameter in the output is new with a random slope for SES?

BONUS: You get a warning here. What is it and why might you be getting it?

8. Compare the level-1 predictor model of SES with a fixed slope and random intercept (question 5) to the intercept-only model (question 4). Now, compare the level-1 predictor model of SES with a random slope and random intercept (question 7) to the intercept-only model. How does your inference differ? What do these different LRTs tell you?

9. Run a model to determine of students nested within classrooms to determine if the level 2 predictor of teacher's preparatory courses predict child's improvement in scores?

10. Run a model with an interaction between student level SES and classroom level preparatory courses (i.e. cross-level interaction) predicting child math improvements, without modeling either as a random slope.

11. Run a model with a cross-level interaction between student level SES and classroom level preparatory courses predicting child math improvement, while modeling SES as a random slope.

BONUS: What looks different between the model in question eight versus the model in question nine? Why might this be?
